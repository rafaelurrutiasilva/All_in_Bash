<img width="220" alt="All_in_Bash" src="https://github.com/rafaelurrutiasilva/images/blob/main/logos/bash_logo.png" align=left> <br>
In this repo you will find a bunch of scripts written in Bash.<br>
They are categorized for various purposes, such as modern apps, observability, monitoring, and more.<br><br>
All scripts are present in my other repositories but are gathered here for easier access and organization.<br>

## A Mix of Originality and Community Inspiration
It is not my intention to steal or take credit for others' work. My scripts are a product of both my own creation and a lot of borrowing and inspiration from like-minded individuals out there on forums, manuals, and the internet.

## Modern Apps and Observability

## Monitoring and Nagios Check
