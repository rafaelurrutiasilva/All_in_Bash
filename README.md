<img width="220" alt="All_in_Bash" src="https://github.com/rafaelurrutiasilva/images/blob/main/logos/bash_logo.png" align=left> <br>
In this repo you will find a bunch of scripts written in Bash.<br>
They are categorized for various purposes, such as modern apps, observability, monitoring, and more.<br> 
All scripts are present in my other repositories but are gathered here for easier access and organization.<br>
